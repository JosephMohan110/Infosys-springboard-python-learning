It not only affects human health—causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases—but also has a significant impact on climate change and ecosystem health. Monitoring and forecasting air quality allows governments, industries, and citizens to take proactive measures.

# Key pollutants often measured include:
# PM2.5 & PM10: Particulate matter with diameters <2.5μm and <10μm. Can penetrate lungs and bloodstream
# NO2, CO, O3: Gases contributing to smog, respiratory issues, and global warming
# Temperature & Humidity: Environmental factors that influence pollutant dispersion

# Objective of this module:

# Download real-world air quality data from trusted sources like CPCB (India) or OpenAQ (Global)
# Preprocess data to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features
# Explore patterns, trends, and correlations via Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Tools & Libraries:
# Python widely used for data analysis and machine learning
# Pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering
# NumPy  for fast numerical computations
# Matplotlib & Seaborn  for visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations
# OpenAQ / CPCB  sources of historical air quality measurements


# Step 1: Download and Load Dataset

# Air quality data is collected by governmental and independent agencies through monitoring stations. These datasets may contain hourly, daily, or irregular time-stamped measurements. Before analysis, it is essential to load the data into a structured format (like Pandas DataFrame) to inspect it for completeness, correctness, and usability
# Download CSV/Excel from CPCB or OpenAQ.
# Load data into Pandas

# import pandas as pd
# data = pd.read_csv("air_quality_data.csv")



# Step 2: Data Preprocessing

# Real-world datasets are rarely clean. Preprocessing ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable for analysis. Poor preprocessing can lead to misleading results or inaccurate predictions

# 3.1 Handling Missing Values

# Missing values occur due to sensor failures, transmission errors, or skipped measurements
# Fill with mean/median for numerical columns
# Fill with mode for categorical data
# Drop rows if missing values are too frequent

# 3.2 Converting Data Types

# Dates/timestamps must be in datetime format to allow resampling and time-based feature extraction
# Numeric columns should be properly typed for calculations

# 3.3 Removing Duplicates

# Sometimes, repeated entries occur due to logging errors or repeated downloads
# Removing duplicates prevents biased statistics and improves model reliability

# 3.4 Feature Selection

# Only retain features relevant to air quality prediction, such as pollutant levels, temperature, and humidity
# Irrelevant features increase computational cost and can reduce model accuracy





# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# EDA is critical to understand patterns, trends, distributions, and relationships in the dataset before building predictive models. It helps answer questions like:

# 4.1 Trend Analysis

# Visualize pollutants over time using line plots
# Identify seasonal trends, daily peaks, or periods of high pollution

# 4.2 Correlation Analysis

# Use heatmaps to understand relationships between variables
# Strong correlations may indicate predictive relationships useful for forecasting

# 4.3 Distribution Analysis

# Boxplots and histograms reveal the spread of pollutant levels
# Outliers may indicate extreme events or sensor errors




# Step 4: Resampling Data

# Air quality measurements may be irregular (e.g., hourly, irregular gaps)
# Resampling aggregates data to a consistent frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) using mean, median, or sum




# Step 5: Feature Preparation for Forecasting

# Predictive models perform better when they have additional features that capture time dependencies and trends
# Lag Features: Capture previous pollutant values to help the model learn patterns over time
# Rolling/Moving Averages: Smooth short-term fluctuations to highlight long-term trends
# Date-based Features: Include day-of-week, month, or season to capture seasonal effects on pollution
