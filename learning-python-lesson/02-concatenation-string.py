        #JOIN SOME STRING....

#Concatenation of a string means joining two or more strings together to form one single string.

a= "Hello"+" "+"world"
print(a)


a="r"*10
print(a)


str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)


#*************

var=1
var1=2
#print("var+var")    #here python will print var+var. python consider it as string...value of var will not print..,if we put double inverted cooma "" we want to remove this comma to print the value of var
print(var+var1)


print("joseph + mohan")    #it just print includeing symbol


print("joseph"+"mohan")


print("love "+"you")  # space is provided b/w love you there are many way given below......a space can give after word >love< or before wordd >you<


print("good"+" luck")


print("kiss "+" you")


print("brake " +" it")        #if we give a space before and after the symbol "+" this space will not be considered
print("brake " + " it")
print("brake "  + " it")


print("boy" " "+"girl")  #if we want to give a space between boy and girl we can consider SPACE " " as a string. space is consider as a string



print('string manipulation exerise"\nString concetenation is done with "+" sign\nprint("Hello"+"Joseph")')
print('string manipulation exerise"\n String concetenation is done with "+" sign\n print("Hello"+"Joseph")')    #if we give a space after \n ten a space will create berfore startin second string


print(123+1)  #it will add and give result as 124

#print("123"+3)  it will show error because one is string and oter is integer

print("123"+"1")   #it will concatenat 123 and 1 = 1231 it is consider as a string, because elements are written in the inverted comma " "..


print("10+10")       # just concatenation occur...
print("10"+"10")


print(int("10")+ int("10"))  #here 10 is converted into string using int function..now addition willl occur..


print(int("10"+"10")) #10 +10 concatenate here...just 10+10 will print it will not add...10+10 consider as a string.. here 10 and next 10 will concatenat and then it is converted into integer..
print((int("11"+"11"))+(int("11"+"11")))  #"11"+"11" will concatenat and occur 1111...and next also like this..1111 now both 1111 will add..(1111+1111)=2222


#below 3 methode is there all are same
print(int((10)+(10)))  #here 10 +10 will add and 20... evida 10 string ayii consider cheyuthittu illa.. 10 is consider as a integer..and addition will occur..
print(int(10+10))  #here 10 +10 will add and 20... evida 10 string ayii consider cheyuthittu illa.. it is consider as a integer..
print(int(10)+int(10))  #here 10 +10 will add and 20... evida 10 string ayii consider cheyuthittu illa.. it is consider as a integer..
print(int(10)+int("10"))


#   10   it is integer
#   "10"   it is string...string is converted into integer..as 10..
