# MODULE: DATA PREPROCESSING & EDA – AIR QUALITY DATASET


# 1. Introduction

# Air pollution is a major environmental concern affecting health and climate
# Predicting air quality requires historical pollutant data, such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, temperature, humidity, etc.
# This module focuses on downloading real-world air quality data, preprocessing it, exploring trends, and preparing features for forecasting models.



# 2. Step 1: Download and Load Dataset

# Air quality datasets can be downloaded from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or government sources.
# After downloading, the dataset is loaded into a suitable environment for analysis.
# The first step in understanding data is to examine its structure, number of rows/columns, column names, and data types.
# This gives insight into what cleaning or preprocessing steps may be required



# 3. Step 2: Data Preprocessing

# Data preprocessing is critical to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis

# 3.1 Handling Missing Values

# Real-world datasets often have missing or null values
# Missing values can be removed or replaced with appropriate statistics like mean, median, or mode
# This step ensures that missing data does not skew analysis or predictions

# 3.2 Converting Data Types

# Columns such as dates or timestamps need to be in proper datetime format for analysis
# Numerical columns might require type conversion to ensure calculations are accurate


# 3.3 Removing Duplicates

# Duplicate rows can appear due to repeated data collection
# Removing duplicates prevents biased analysis and ensures accurate forecasting

# 3.4 Feature Selection
# Only relevant features (like pollutant levels, temperature, humidity) are retained for analysis
# Irrelevant or redundant features are dropped to simplify the dataset and improve model performance



# 4. Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# EDA helps to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before modeling

# 4.1 Trend Analysis

# Plotting pollutant levels over time shows rising or falling trends in air quality
# Helps identify seasonal patterns or periods of high pollution

# 4.2 Correlation Analysis

# Examining correlations between pollutants and other variables (like temperature, humidity) reveals how different factors influence air quality
# Strong correlations may indicate predictive relationships for forecasting

# 4.3 Distribution Analysis

# Understanding the distribution of pollutants helps detect outliers or unusual data points
# Outliers may indicate extreme events like pollution spikes or sensor errors




# 5. Step 4: Resampling Data

# Air quality datasets may have irregular time intervals, such as hourly measurements
# Resampling allows aggregation to daily, weekly, or monthly averages
# This smoothens the data and ensures consistent time intervals, which is critical for time series forecasting



# 6. Step 5: Feature Preparation for Forecasting

# To improve predictive models, additional features are created:
# Lag Features → previous time steps of pollutant levels, which help the model learn trends over time
# Rolling Averages / Moving Averages → smooth short-term fluctuations to capture overall trends
# Date-based Features → day of the week, month, season, or holiday effects
# These features enhance model accuracy and help capture complex patterns in air quality data.
